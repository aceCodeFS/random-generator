# Random Library Showcase
This repository is only a basic preview, consisting of a few minimal lines of code to give a brief understanding of the random library.

## Read the in-code comments for explainations on what each function does.

## Quick setup
Random is a built-in library.
```
import random
```
is all you need to use the random library.
