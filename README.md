# Random Library Showcase
This repository is only a basic preview, consisting of a few minimal lines of code to give a brief understanding of the random library.

## Read the in-code comments for explainations on what each function and line does.

## Requirements
Random is a built-in library.
other libraries used such as time and os, are also built-in and simply require an import line. Such as:
### Import a library
```
import random
```
is all you need to use the random library. This will also work with any other built-in library.

# File contents
All files in this repo relate to the random python library

## main.py
main.py shows basic random functions, a small explaination and example outputs.

## guess_the_number.py
guess_the_number showcases a basic guess the number game in which it will ask for a difficulty, changing the range of the random possible number from 1-10 all the way to 1-1000.
After it generates a random number, the user will get a chance to guess the generated number.
The file also contains input checks such as typechecks verifying the guess input is either "end" to end the game or a number. Any other input will not work.
